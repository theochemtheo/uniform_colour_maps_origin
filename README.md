## CET Perceptually Uniform Colour Maps - Formatted for Origin

This repository consists of the [CET perceptually uniform colour map series](https://peterkovesi.com/projects/colourmaps/), created by [Peter Kovesi](https://peterkovesi.com/).

These colour maps have been reformatted into the [JASC Palette format](http://liero.nl/lierohack/docformats/other-jasc.html), which is readable by [Origin](https://www.originlab.com/).

# Using the colour maps
It is simple to import external palettes into Origin.

First, download the [`palettes.zip`](../blob/master/palettes.zip) file and extract it.
You can then [follow the instructions](https://www.originlab.com/doc/Quick-Help/Use-External-Color-Palette) on OriginLab's website for how to include them in Origin.

# What are pereceptually uniform colour maps?
Perceptually uniform colour maps are ways of mapping a numerical value onto a series of colours in a way
that tries to ensure that the numerical difference between values matches the 'perceptual distance' between
the colours they are mapped on to. This ensures to spot patterns in data, and, perhaps more importantly, not
be tricked by the colour used to represent the data.

You can learn more about the utility of perceptually uniform colour maps [here](https://bids.github.io/colormap/).

Please read the paper on the arXiv by the author of the maps, Peter Kovesi: [`arXiv:1509/03700`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03700).
